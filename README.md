# AWS Persistant Spot Intance

Forked from https://github.com/atramos/ec2-spotter

EC2 spot instances behave much like regular instances, but are cheaper. 
Normally, they can only be inited from an AMI image, not EBS volume, resetting any changes made along the way.
This script enables you to continue with your Spot instance where you left off.
